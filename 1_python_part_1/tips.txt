Problem solving: 
To solve complex problems we need to breaking them into smaller parts
starting by writing steps in simple english.

Example: measuring water with the help of two odd containers
We only have two bottles, 3 liter bottle and a 5 liter bottle
Tasks: measure 2 liter of water, measure 1 liter of water, measure 4 liters of water
Rules: we have as much water as we need and we may fill and pour any bottle into any other bottle or drain a bottle entirely
 as many times as needed
    The next task is to measure 4 liters of water.
        Fill the 3 liter bottle with water. 
        1.Pour water from the 3 liter bottle two times to fill the 5 liter bottle
        2.Save the remaining 1 liter of water in the 3 liter bottle
        3.Drain entirely the 5 liter bottle of water.
        4.Pour the remaining 1 liter of  water into the empty 5 liter bottle.
        5.Fill the 3 liter bottle 
        6.Pour water from the 3 liter bottle to the 5 liter bottle
        The remaining water in the 5 liter bottle are 4 liters

Program: A program is a set of instructions to solve a problem.
Variable: Is a quantity that may change within the context of a problem or solution

The process of problem solving
The four stages of problem solving:
    1. Analyze: Understand the available resources and constraints of a problem
    2. Plan: Write the steps that solve the problem in the form of program. 
        This is the plan of action that will solve the problem
    3. Implement: Execute a computer program to obtain results
    4. Evaluate: Match the results of the program with the desired output to determine success

    ANALIZE -> PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> EVALUATE

    -Use simple language
